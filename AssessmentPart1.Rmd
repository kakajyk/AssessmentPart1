Assessment Part 1

In GIS, each map is produced from a different source, such as the Census Statistics website and the University Library website. Both of the described maps are generated using different software applications, the main difference being the interface and its different aspects of use. GUI has both advantages and disadvantages. Both RStudio and ArcGIS applications can handle common file types such as shapefiles, Geojson, datasets, geodatabases, and more. The command-line interface is known to handle complex operations better, such as analyzing dataset operations with many objects, automating repetitive tasks, but with poor visual intuition. In contrast, graphical user interface applications outperform advanced visual maps. A closer look at the map generated by ArcGIS describes various shape files that describe the characteristics of each file as geographic information. Different types of feature layers have been added to the described map, such as county boundaries, urban areas, waters, transportation routes, postal codes, and bay area bridges. We use the buffering function and set it on each of the three bay area bridges. The purpose of the map is to evaluate all postal code areas that are 10 km from one of the bay area bridges. Since San Francisco is a highly endangered earthquake zone, this map can be used to inform residents about evacuation options and routes during an earthquake. In addition, more feature layers have been selected to complete visuals with important features. Compared to ArcMap, the RStudio map shows how many universities are in each state in the United States. We use contour maps to visualize. Similar to ArcGIS, RStudio has a variety of options for displaying data. These options can be loaded into the software as packages, each of which can complete a task or property. In this case, use a generic map of the United States, using only the state's border outline (from the University of Michigan). Both software applications allow uploading of data sets, but to do this, you must very accurately clear the data from any special characters in the table and add extra no-number symbols to the header to avoid errors. In this case, there are two data sets uploaded to R, all US university and state files, which also include longitude and latitude geographic information. Since both data sets contain the name of the state, in this special case, the state name of the dataset of the state is lowercase, and the state name of the university file is uppercase. There are some functions in R, such as the diplyr function, in which case "mutate" and "set" are used to change characters and variables. Once this is done, you can use the head function to view the data set. Finally, we visualize the data using the contour map function in the ggplot package. In the contour map, due to the way we draw the boundaries of the area, MAUP (a modifiable area unit problem) affects the accuracy within the map.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
